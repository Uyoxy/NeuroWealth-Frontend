NeuroWealth 💰

AI-Powered DeFi Yield Platform on Stellar

NeuroWealth is an autonomous AI investment agent that automatically manages and grows your crypto assets on the Stellar blockchain. Deposit once, let the AI find the best yield opportunities across Stellar's DeFi ecosystem — and withdraw anytime with no lock-ups.



Overview
Traditional savings accounts offer near-zero interest. Traditional DeFi is too complex for most users. NeuroWealth bridges the gap  a simple chat interface web  powered by an AI agent that autonomously deploys your funds into the highest-yielding, safest opportunities on Stellar.

Why Stellar?

Transaction fees of fractions of a penny — perfect for frequent AI-driven rebalancing
3–5 second finality — the AI can act on market changes instantly
Native DEX + Soroban smart contracts — composable, programmable yield strategies
Native USDC + XLM — borderless capital movement with no friction
Growing DeFi ecosystem — Blend (lending), Templar (borrowing), RWA protocols

How It Works
1. User deposits USDC via web app
       ↓
2. Soroban vault contract receives and records the deposit
       ↓
3. Contract emits a deposit event
       ↓
4. AI agent detects the event and deploys funds to best protocol (e.g. Blend)
       ↓
5. Yield accumulates 24/7 — agent rebalances hourly if better opportunities exist
       ↓
6. User requests withdrawal anytime → agent pulls funds → sends back in seconds
Three Investment Strategies

Conservative — Stablecoin lending on Blend. Low risk, steady 3–6% APY.
Balanced — Mix of lending + DEX liquidity provision. Medium risk, 6–10% APY.
Growth — Aggressive multi-protocol deployment. Higher risk, 10–15% APY.

WhatsApp Integration
NeuroWealth is designed to be fully operable through WhatsApp, making it accessible to anyone with a smartphone — no wallet app or browser extension needed.
User Flow
1. User sends "hi" to NeuroWealth WhatsApp number
2. Bot introduces itself and asks for phone number verification (OTP)
3. OTP verified → agent creates a Stellar keypair for this user (custodial)
4. User can now deposit, withdraw, and check balance entirely through chat
5. Funds are secured in the Soroban vault contract under their wallet address
Setting Up the Webhook
bash# Your webhook endpoint receives WhatsApp messages
POST /api/whatsapp/webhook

# Register your webhook URL with Twilio
# ngrok http 3000  ← for local testing
Example Conversation
User:    deposit 100 USDC
Agent:   Got it! Depositing 100 USDC into your Balanced strategy.
         This should take about 5 seconds on Stellar... ✅ Done!
         You're now earning ~8.4% APY. I'll optimize automatically.

User:    what's my balance?
Agent:   💰 Your NeuroWealth Portfolio
         Balance: 100.23 USDC
         Earnings today: +$0.23
         Current APY: 8.4%
         Strategy: Balanced

User:    withdraw everything
Agent:   Withdrawing 100.23 USDC... ✅ Done!
         Funds sent to your wallet. Arrived in 4 seconds.

```

### Database Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL (version 12 or higher)
2. Create the database:
   ```bash
   createdb neurowealth
   ```
3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   psql -d neurowealth -f backend/migrations/001_create_users_table.sql
   psql -d neurowealth -f backend/migrations/002_create_deposits_table.sql
   ```

### Stellar Network Configuration

- **Testnet**: Use `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` for development
- **Mainnet**: Use `https://horizon.stellar.org` for production

The deposit monitor will automatically connect to the configured Horizon endpoint and stream payment events for all registered user wallet addresses.

## Deposit Detection System

The deposit detection system monitors user Stellar wallet addresses for incoming USDC deposits in real-time using the Horizon streaming API.

### How It Works

1. **Monitoring**: When a user completes onboarding and receives a wallet address, the deposit monitor establishes a streaming connection to Horizon API
2. **Detection**: USDC deposits are detected within 10 seconds of Stellar confirmation
3. **Recording**: Deposits are recorded in PostgreSQL with idempotency (duplicate transactions are ignored)
4. **Notification**: Users receive WhatsApp confirmation messages at two stages:
   - "Deposit Received" - immediately after detection
   - "Funds Deployed" - after AI agent deploys funds to yield strategy
5. **Deployment**: The system emits deployment events for external AI agent handlers

### Key Features

- Real-time streaming with automatic reconnection
- Exponential backoff for connection failures (1s to 60s max)
- Transaction hash-based idempotency
- Atomic database transactions for portfolio updates
- Graceful error handling with user notifications

### Services

- **Deposit Monitor**: Streams payment events from Stellar Horizon
- **Deposit Recorder**: Records deposits in database with idempotency
- **Deployment Coordinator**: Emits deployment events and handles confirmations
- **Deposit Messaging**: Sends WhatsApp notifications for deposit lifecycle events
